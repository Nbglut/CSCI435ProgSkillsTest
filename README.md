CSCI 435: Programming Skills Test

This program is written in python and uses four libraries, most of which are part of python's standard library. The only non-standard library used is the PIL (Python Imaging Library) or Pillow library which must be installed. One way to install the library is through pip, using the command  "pip install pillow"


In order to run the script, cd into the file with it and then use either the command

py annotateAndroidPNGTool.py <app.package> <screen #>
or
python3 annotateAndroidPNGTool.py <app.package> <screen #>

with two possible command line arguments, the first being the app.package name and the second being the screen number. If there is no screen number, leave the second command line argument blank.
